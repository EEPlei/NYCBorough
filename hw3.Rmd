1. Cleaning Data 
Since we have such a large dataset, we begin by learning some things about our data. Then, we can begin cleaning the data, so we have accurate data to work with. 
Let's take a look at what kind of information our data tells us.     
`colnames(nyc)`
We'll get back the folowing results       
 [1] "Unique.Key"                     "Created.Date"                  
 [3] "Closed.Date"                    "Agency"                        
 [5] "Agency.Name"                    "Complaint.Type"                
 [7] "Descriptor"                     "Location.Type"                 
 [9] "Incident.Zip"                   "Incident.Address"              
[11] "Street.Name"                    "Cross.Street.1"                
[13] "Cross.Street.2"                 "Intersection.Street.1"         
[15] "Intersection.Street.2"          "Address.Type"                  
[17] "City"                           "Landmark"                      
[19] "Facility.Type"                  "Status"                        
[21] "Due.Date"                       "Resolution.Description"        
[23] "Resolution.Action.Updated.Date" "Community.Board"               
[25] "Borough"                        "Park.Facility.Name"            
[27] "Park.Borough"                   "School.Name"                   
[29] "School.Number"                  "School.Region"                 
[31] "School.Code"                    "School.Phone.Number"           
[33] "School.Address"                 "School.City"                   
[35] "School.State"                   "School.Zip"                    
[37] "School.Not.Found"               "School.or.Citywide.Complaint"  
[39] "Vehicle.Type"                   "Taxi.Company.Borough"          
[41] "Taxi.Pick.Up.Location"          "Bridge.Highway.Name"           
[43] "Bridge.Highway.Direction"       "Road.Ramp"                     
[45] "Bridge.Highway.Segment"         "Garage.Lot.Name"               
[47] "Ferry.Direction"                "Ferry.Terminal.Name"   
Since some of these aren't important, we'll subset our `nyc` data to just the following fourteen variables.
```{r}
nyc.important <- nyc[,c("Unique.Key", "Complaint.Type", "Descriptor", "Incident.Zip", 
"Incident.Address", "Street.Name", "Cross.Street.1", "Cross.Street.2", "Intersection.Street
.1", "Intersection.Street.2", "Address.Type", "City", "Resolution.Description", "Borough")]
```

We can begin by subsetting out the two Street Intersection Columns.    
`test1 <- nyc.important$Intersection.Street.1 != ""`    
`test2 <- nyc.important$Intersection.Street.2 != ""`    
`> length(which(test1))`     
`[1] 1817002`     
`> length(which(test2))`     
`[1] 1816062`     
So we can see that there exists cases where Intersection.Street.1 has data but Intersetion.Street.2 does not. This may also be true vice-versa. 
```{r}
nyc.important.2 <- nyc.important[which(nyc.important$Intersection.Street.1 != ""),]
nyc.important.2 <- nyc.important.2[which(nyc.important.2$Intersection.Street.2 != ""),]
```
nyc.important.2 should only have the rows where Intersection.Street.1 and Intersection.Street.2 has data. 
```{r}
nyc.important.3 <- nyc.important.2[which(nyc.important.2$Cross.Street.1 != ""),]
```
