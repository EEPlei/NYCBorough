1. Cleaning Data 
Since we have such a large dataset, we begin by learning some things about our data. Then, we can begin cleaning the data, so we have accurate data to work with. 
Let's take a look at what kind of information our data tells us.     

We can begin by subsetting out the two Street Intersection Columns.    
`test1 <- which(nyc.important$Intersection.Street.1 != "")`    
`test2 <- which(nyc.important$Intersection.Street.2 != "")`    
`> length(test1)`     
`[1] 1817002`     
`> length(test2)`     
`[1] 1816062`
